** SIMPLC# **
** SIMPLC- **

1. What is SIMPLC-?

SIMPLC- is going to be a simple virtual machine, 
with 64K memory*, 8192K memory dedicated to graphics,
2 regular registers and 1 special register (memory-pointer).

2. How do you use it?

	A. Compile it
	B. Write program (see sample, IN.ASM)
	C. Process it with COMPILER
	D. Start machine (this is not possible at the moment)
	E. Load binary file (produced by C.)
	F. ???
	G. Profit.

TODO:

	* Create master project (an executable)
	  for handling of run-time switches
	  and the machine in general
	  (this will probably also handle compiling,
	  using a switch).
	  
	  Also, switch syntax should be something simple,
	  like what 'yum' or 'apt-get' uses, e.g.:
	  
	  simplc compile @file
	  simplc run @bootloader
	  simplc recompile
	  etc.
	
	* Implement proper handling of comments in source files
	  when compiling, e.g.:
	  
	  ; This is a comment, and is ignored!
	  
	  START
	   LDA #20
	   LDX #$A000
	   STA ,X
	   END START
	  ; This is also a comment! \o/
	  
	* Implement a proper MOV mnemonic, e.g.:
	
	  MOV VALUE, REGISTER
	  
	  So we don't have to have one mnemonic for each register.
	  
	* Create 'hardware' for the machine to use, e.g.:
	
	  SCREEN,
	  MOUSE,
	  KEYBOARD,
	  PRINTER(?)
